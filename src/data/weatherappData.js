    description1: "This is one of the first projects that I created. It is a combination of both an HTML/CSS site as well as an Android Studo app. It uses the WeatherAPI API to display data about a city that was user-input.",
    description2: "As mentioned above, there were two parts for this. The first one was the HTML/CSS version. This is a simple site that will allow the user to enter a city and click a button. This will then display several attributes of the weather of that particular city. The android is somewhat similar in that it also allows the user to enter the city that they want the weather of. However, it doesn't display as many attributes as the HTML/CSS version.",

    description4: "This version would allow the user to enter a city and then would display several attributes about the particular city when they press a button. These attributes include the location (state, country), the temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit), and word description of the weather (sunny, raining, etc.). Additioanlly, depending on this description, the background and text color will change. For example, if the weather at a particular city is cloudy, then it would change the background color to grey and the text to white.",
    description5: "Kotlin Version",
    description6: "This version was created using Kotlin and Android Studio, I created it when I was first gaining familiarity with Android Studio and Kotlin. Unlike the other version, this one doesn't display as much information and only displays the temperature in Celsius. However, for this one, the background color changes depending on the temperature of the city rather than the description.  ",
